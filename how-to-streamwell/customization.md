# Customization

The customization section allows you to change certain characteristics about the application. to represent yourself or your brand:

**Site Title **- The name at the top of the browser window and in rich link previews (e.g. “My Studio”).

**Welcome Message **- A dialog which appears one time, when a user logs in. You can use some basic HTML markup in this box if you feel like getting spicy. For example, tags like \<strong>, \<em>, \<p>, \<h2> will work, while scary things like media tags, \<script> or \<?php> will not.

**Brand Logo **- Upload your own PNG logo for use around the site. There are no real constraints on sizing but something around 360x180 px with an alpha channel (transparency) will look best. Anything over 500KB will fail, because that’s simply too big for a logo.

**Player Background** - Upload your own JPG background, shown in the player when video is loading or offline.

**Color Scheme** - Choose your own adventure for header, accent, text, foreground and background colors.
