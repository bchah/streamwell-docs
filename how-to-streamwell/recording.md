# Recording

With stream recordings enabled in Administration -> Server -> Settings, you can start a server-side recording of any stream by clicking the REC button when the stream is live:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 11.17.09 AM.jpg>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 11.17.30 AM.jpg>)

You are free to leave the page while the recording is active. When you stop the recording, it will process on the server and appear in the list once it is ready. You can then playback recordings in the browser as you please, or download them for use elsewhere. The recordings are remuxed into MP4 but not re-encoded, so the exact video data received by the server is what you will see in your recording.

Note: A minimum of 12GB disk space is required to begin a recording. If you don't see a REC button, either you have not enabled recordings or your stream is not live! If you stop and start your stream a bunch while recording, it could start acting weird but it will let you know there was a problem and attempt to save whatever it can.
