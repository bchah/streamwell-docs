# Support & Pro Services

Please see the [Getting Started](broken-reference) section for a complete guide which takes you from installing Streamwell to viewing your first stream over HTTPS. If you hit a roadblock during this process, please [contact us](mailto:help@beamwell.com) for support.&#x20;

Note that support is primarily available to paid users through a maintenance support agreement, as well as white-glove installation assistance, custom development and more. Please [contact us](mailto:help@beamwell.cm) with any service inquiries.

We want all Streamwell users to be successful so even if you are not a paid user and have a question please reach out and we will do our best to help you in an 'ad-hoc' manner.&#x20;
