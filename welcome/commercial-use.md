# Commercial Use

The core functionality of Streamwell is **free of charge** for personal, non-commercial use. Without a license you can:

* Create up to 5 users and 5 channels at a time
* Stream with sub-second latency to up to 25 viewers at once
* Record, playback and download your streams

Streamwell is the product of countless nights of coding, testing and refining by a one-person team. Please help us to sustain these efforts by purchasing a license key at [www.streamwell.net](https://beamwell.com/streamwell) :relaxed:&#x20;

A license key will let you:

* Use Streamwell in a commercial or for-profit setting
