# Free vs. Paid

The core functionality of Streamwell is **free of charge** for individual, non-commercial use. Without a license you can:

* Achieve sub-second latency streaming of H264 (RTMP/SRT) or H265 (SRT) video
* Set a title and notes for your channel
* Record, playback and download your streams
* Create and share a public stream view link
* Upload files and share direct download links
* Evaluate the paid features (albeit limited to a single user)

These additional features become available with a license key, which can be purchased at www.streamwell.net :

* User management including 'client' and 'creator' roles.
* Users can log in and browse channels, participate in text and video chat, view uploaded files in the browser where compatible, and more.
* Create an unlimited number of channels and limit visibility to select users.
* Remove all Streamwell branding.
* Customize the logos and color scheme to match your brand.
* Database backup and restore right in the web browser.

Streamwell is the product of countless nights of coding, testing and refining by a one-person team. Please help make these efforts sustainable by purchasing a license :relaxed:
