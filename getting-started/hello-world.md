# Hello World

With the application now running, you should test the server before you go any further. To do so:

* Open a web browser and go to the IP of the server (If you are on the server itself, use ‘localhost’)
* Log in with the default admin credentials (_admin / vnadmin _- change these later!)

* On the home page, copy the RTMP or SRT stream URL for the channel you just created.
* Point your stream encoder to the stream URL_ _and start your stream.
* You should now be able to connect and view the stream via the home page.&#x20;

**Congratulations!! **With the server running, this is an excellent time to test your hostname for remote access.&#x20;
