# Streaming Engine

Streamwell is built around [OvenMediaEngine](https://www.ovenmediaengine.com), an open-source streaming engine created by Airensoft. OME provides some very cool functionality, some of which made it into this initial release and some of which remains on the roadmap.

For self-hosted installations, there are some advanced configuration options available via the editor under Administration -> Server -> Engine Control -> Configure Engine. It is not recommended to dive in here unless you have a good understanding of the fundamentals (and a backup of the original config!).

More info on engine configuration can be found here: [https://airensoft.gitbook.io/ovenmediaengine/configuration](https://airensoft.gitbook.io/ovenmediaengine/configuration)

OvenMediaEngine and OvenPlayer are licensed under the Apache and MIT licenses respectively. They are included as functional components of the Streamwell application and are not directly supported, except for advanced installations or via professional services.
