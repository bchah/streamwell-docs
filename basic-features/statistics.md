# Statistics

With statistics enabled in Administration -> Server -> Settings, you can view live metrics about your stream, including how much data has moved in and out of the server:

The 'direct stream' link is an HLS URL to let viewers watch your live stream completely outside of Streamwell. It can be used with hardware or software decoders, popular applications like VLC, or even just pasted directly into a web browser on iPhone or iPad. The only caveat with the HLS stream is that it is more 'traditional' in terms of the stream delay - users should expect a roughly 15 second delay.
